A backend-driven Sales Order & Inventory Management System built using Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF).
The system allows admin users to manage products, inventory, and dealers, while dealers can place orders with automatic stock validation and tracking.
If user create dby superuser and if he is a staff then only he can access the inventory
BAckend is the first priority while designing the project
Tried to use more functionalities in the same project.
